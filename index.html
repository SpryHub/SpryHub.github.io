        <h2><em>Want a simple velocity and project reporting on GitHub Issues? You're in the right place.</em></h2>

<h3>
<a name="velocity-reports" class="anchor" href="#velocity-reports"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Velocity Reports</h3>

<p>The minimum requirement to get Spry Hub reporting on your projects is to assign point labels to your issues, and organizing you issues into miletsones for each sprint. </p>

<p>Every day you'll receive a report with your current sprint velocity, a summary of the currently running sprint, and your completed sprints.</p>

<h3>
<a name="sprint-management" class="anchor" href="#sprint-management"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sprint Management</h3>

<p>We can automate your sprint management. Assign priorities and points to your issues. We'll deal with the hassle of creating milestones, assigning tickets based on priority, points, and velocity.  At the end of the sprint we'll even close the milestone and move unfinished tickets to the backlog. Feel free to re-arrange the sprints after we generated them.</p>

<a name="why-spry-hub" class="anchor" href="#why-spry-hub"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Spry Hub</h3>

<p>If you're like us you're tired of project management tools that require as much work as your project. To avoid the complexity of Pivotal Tracker or Jira, we devised a strategy to manage agile projects in GitHub using milestones and labels. After a while, we discovered we spent a lot of time generating sprint reports and organizing so we automated some of that work.</p>

<p>We hope you'll find it as useful as we did. It's not hard to do, but small pieces of automation in the right place can be very effective. It's saving us 8-10 hours per week right now and will be worth so much more as we grow. Get in now so you can guide the product and get grandfathered in as we add more advanced features and expand our offering.</p>
