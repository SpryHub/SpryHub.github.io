{"name":"SpryHub.io","tagline":"Agile Project Management for GitHub","body":"Want a simple system to track velocity and performance on GitHub? You're in the right place.\r\n\r\n### Velocity Reports\r\n\r\nThe minimal requirement to get Spry Hub reporting on your projects is to assign point labels to your issues, and create milestones for your sprints. \r\n\r\nWe use the following labels: points/0, points/1, points/2, points/3, points/5, points/8.\r\nWe use a simple naming convention for sprints that include a start and a stop date such as Sprint 2013/10/07 2013/10/20. \r\n\r\nEvery day you'll receive a report with your current sprint velocity, a summary of the currently running sprint, and your completed sprints.\r\n\r\n### Sprint Management\r\n\r\nWe can automate your sprint management for you. All you have to do is begin assigning priorities to your GitHub issues and let us know how long your sprints are and give us a start date. At the beginning of a sprint we will close any open milestones and move any incomplete issues to the backlog. We'll generate a new sprint milestone and assign issues based on their priority up to your current velocity.\r\n\r\nThis requires you to groom and prioritize your backlog. \r\n\r\n### Time Estimates\r\n\r\nIf your team can assign difficulty to all the tickets in your backlogs, we can produce time estimates based based on your current velocity as a part of your reports. These estimates will be included in your daily velocity reports. \r\n\r\n### Plans \r\n|    |Free |5USD/mo|20USD/mo|\r\n|----|-----|-------|--------|\r\n|Velocity Reports|X|X|X|\r\n|Sprint Management|||X|\r\n|Time Estimates|||X|\r\n\r\nThe free plan is only available for public/open source projects.

If you'd like to try out SpryHub [open an issue](https://github.com/spry-group/spryhub.io/issues/new) and we'll get you setup.\r\n\r\n### Let us know what you want.\r\n\r\nWe'd love your feedback and suggestions. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/spry-group/spryhub.io/issues/new) and let us know what you want.\r\n\r\n### Why Spry Hub\r\n\r\nIf you're like us you're tired of project management tools that require as much work as your project. To avoid the complexity of Pivotal Tracker or Jira, we devised a strategy to manage agile projects in GitHub using milestones and labels. After a while, we discovered we spent a lot of time generating sprint reports and organizing so we automated some of that work.\r\n\r\nWe hope you'll work with us to create some awesome practices for managing projects on GitHub, and building simple non-invasive analytics and reporting around it. If you're feeling lazy we hope you'll subscribe to our service and help us build effortless project management tools.\r\n","google":"UA-45089821-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
